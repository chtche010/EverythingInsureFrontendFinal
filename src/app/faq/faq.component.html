                We all face some sort of risk on a daily basis. These are unforeseen and unpredictable events that can result in liability to you or loss or damage to your assets. The risks we want to avoid or insure against are those that we cannot recover from based on our savings and personal support system and would require us to borrow from a third party lender which will result in financial hardship. This is why insurance is an important instrument to protect ourselves against unexpected events such as accidents, fire, severe weather, theft and so much more. Insurance protects you against a financial setback and helps restore you to the position you were before the event.

                A professional and qualified broker will understand your personal circumstance and risk appetite, will analyse your risk profile and the exposures you face, will highlight what is insurable and what not and will make design or recommendations on the best product solutions available to you. These products are often only available to you via a licensed professional intermediary such as Everything.Insure and cannot be bought directly. Everything.Insure will also generally provide these products to you at preferentially negotiated pricing because of their strategic relationships with insurers. Your broker is also available to provide ongoing advice, make policy amendments, submit and finalise claims on your behalf. Everything.Insure allows you to do any of these functions yourself by giving you access to our state of the art technology that enables you to safely and securely self-serve. Your broker is your agent, has your best interests at heart and always acts on your behalf with no alignment to any product provider, service provider or insurer.

                No. Contrary to statements by direct insurers there is no extra cost to have a broker and no need to cut out the middle-man. In fact your broker (like your accountant, tax advisor and lawyer) provides a vital technical service that is best left to a professional even though you can do it yourself. Many benchmark studies have shown that the cost of insurance via a broker is no more expensive than buying directly and is often cheaper with the added benefit of having a professional to advise you through the complexities choosing the right covers and then navigating a complex claim.

                Business insurance includes a broad range of covers and is designed to protect your business from financial loss. Every business has its own unique set of risks, which means an insurance policy must be tailored to the business. Many factors, from the size of your company, to the number of workers you employ, the materials they handle and whether you have business vehicles, will determine the specific coverage you need to mitigate risk and protect your company's financials.
